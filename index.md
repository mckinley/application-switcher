# Tab Application Switcher

Tab Application Switcher (TAS)

[Install from the chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-application-switcher/mfcjanplaceclfoipcengelejgfngcan)

It's like your system's Application Switcher, but for your Chrome tabs:
- Tabs can be accessed with intelligent and configurable keyboard shortcuts, very similar to your operating system's application switcher.
- Tabs are ordered by their last use. The last tab you used is the first tab to select.

Additional features to help you find and access your tabs:
- Tabs can be searched by url and page title.
- Access your tabs in the chrome omnibox by typing 'tas' then `tab`.
- Display appears in your current active window when using the keyboard shortcut. It is also available as an extension action in the chrome menu area.

Default keyboard shortcuts:
- The current window must have focus to use keyboard shortcuts.
- Hold `alt` and press `tab` to activate TAS.
- Continue holding `alt`, and press `tab` again to move forward through the list of tabs.
- Continue holding `alt`, and press `` ` `` to move backward through the list of tabs.
- Release `alt` to select the highlighted tab.

Additional commands:
- Use the up and down arrows to move through the list of tabs.
- Press `enter` to select the highlighted tab.
- Press `esc` to close TAS without making a selection.

Limitations:

- Tab Application Switcher will not automatically select a tab while focus is in the address bar (omnibox).
If you find that your selected tab is not activating when you release the modifier key, you may need to click the desired tab in TAS with your mouse.
- Keyboard shortcuts will not activate TAS on the Chrome Web Store, on New Tab pages, or on other settings-like pages (urls starting with chrome://).
Click the extension icon to activate TAS in these situations.
- It is possible that other extensions or system preferences can conflict with TAS keyboard shortcuts.
The Options panel can be used to change TAS keyboard shortcuts. Further management can be done here: chrome://extensions/shortcuts
